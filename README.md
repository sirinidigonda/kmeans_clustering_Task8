Task 8: Clustering with K-Means

Objective:
Perform unsupervised learning using the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their behavior and spending patterns.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Dataset:
Mall Customers Dataset
This dataset includes customer details such as:
Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)

Steps Performed:
Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.
Preprocessed the data by dropping non-numeric columns.
Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (K).
Applied K-Means clustering and assigned cluster labels to the data.
Visualized the clusters in 2D using PCA.
Evaluated the model using the Silhouette Score.

Output:
Elbow Method Graph: Helped determine the best value for K.
Cluster Visualization: Shows clusters in 2D space.
Silhouette Score: 0.36 – indicating moderate separation between clusters.
